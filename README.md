#URL Shortener

This app is named Magic! Link

##Description

This app offers reliable URL shortening which is very simple very simple to use. Just paste your link in the form on the home page and submit. You will be redirected to a result page with your shortened link.

##Technology used

This app is built with Rails 5.0.0 and Ruby 2.3.3 on the backend. The database is SQLite3.

##Things to improve

I am still not satisfied with my generated URLs. I would like to generate a real random token. Since most url shorteners appear to be using a 6 characters string made up of digits from 0 to 9 and letters from a to z (both upper and lower case)

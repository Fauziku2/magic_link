##Technology used

This app is built with Rails 5.0.0 and Ruby 2.3.3 on the backend. The database is SQLite3.

##Things to improve

I am still not satisfied with my generated URLs. I would like to generate a real random token. Since most url shorteners appear to be using a 6 characters string made up of digits from 0 to 9 and letters from a to z (both upper and lower case)
